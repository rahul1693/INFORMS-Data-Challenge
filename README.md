# INFORMS-Data-Challenge


**Objective 1**: Quantify stresses in each environment by aggregating environmental data into useful metrics representing **Heat and Drought stress**

**Objective 2**: Use the stresses Identified in Objective 1 to **classify corn hybrids** into being resistant or susceptible to these stresses caused in environments

Scope:
* Personalize crop to conditions
* Predict corn hyrbids which are resistant to 2 most dominant stresses


Data:
* Performance Dataset: 2452 hybrids performance in 1560 locations is provided from 2008 to 2017

    + Features: Hybrid ID, Yield , Env ID, plant date, harvest date, Year, irrigation status and soil properties

* Weather Dataset: Weather data for each location for each data throught the year

    + Features: Env ID, Year, Day number, Day length, Precipition, Solar Radiation, Min and Max Temperature and Vapor Pressure
